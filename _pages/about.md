I am Steve Drew (He Zhu, 祝贺). Currently, I am Chief Architect at
[BitOcean Global](https://oceanex.pro/). I am also Founder
of [BitQubic](https://www.bitqubic.com). Besides, I am a sessional
instructor at Carleton University. I was a Senior Cloud
Engineer at Cisco NFV Group.

I received my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering
from Carleton University in 2018. I have a broad
research interest AIOps, edge computing, cloud-native initiatives
towards network services and blockchain services.
